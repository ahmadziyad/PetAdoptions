# Pet Adoptions Project

## Description
This project is a **Smart Pet Adoption Platform** built with **Spring Boot**. It is designed to modernize the pet adoption process by leveraging **Artificial Intelligence**.
Key technologies include:
- **Spring AI**: For integrating AI models.
- **Amazon Bedrock**: As the AI model provider.
- **PGVector**: For vector storage, enabling semantic search and intelligent matching.

The goal is to move beyond simple filter-based searches (e.g., "Dog", "Golden Retriever") to a system that understands compatibility, finding the right pet for an adopter's specific lifestyle and personality.

## Pet Adoption Steps

The typical adoption process supported by this system involves the following steps:

1.  **User Registration & Profiling**:
    *   Adopters sign up and complete a detailed profile.
    *   AI analyzes the profile to understand lifestyle, living conditions, and preferences.

2.  **Browse & Match**:
    *   **Search**: Users can browse available pets with standard filters.
    *   **Smart Recommendations**: The system recommends pets based on semantic matching (e.g., "Good for apartments," "High energy companion") using vector embeddings.

3.  **Application**:
    *   User selects a pet and submits an adoption application.
    *   The system can pre-screen applications or highlight strong matches for shelter staff.

4.  **Interaction**:
    *   Scheduling "Meet & Greets" (virtual or in-person).
    *   Chat with shelter staff (or an AI assistant) to answer specific questions about the pet.

5.  **Approval & Finalization**:
    *   Staff reviews and approves the application.
    *   Digital signing of adoption agreements.
    *   Payment of adoption fees.

6.  **Post-Adoption Support**:
    *   Access to resources, care guides, and community support for new pet parents.
